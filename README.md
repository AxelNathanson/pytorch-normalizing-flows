# pytorch-normalizing-flows
Implementation of a simple flow and RealNVP in Pytorch. 

The training and visulization can be found in the notebook and the models in the flow_model-file. 

The three datasets that I trained the RealNVP on where the moon-dataset, a circle and mutiple gaussians all with a fixed distance from the origin.
